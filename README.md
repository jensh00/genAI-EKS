Deploy Generative AI Models on Amazon EKS

GenAI models represent a significant breakthrough in the field of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, due to its wide ranging applicability along with easy accessibility for non-AI experts. Traditionally, utilizing AI meant creation of a specialized model for each specific use-case, which required a huge amount of compute and human resources each time. GenAI models overcome this bottleneck by creating Foundation Models (FM). FMs allow reuse by providing ability to fine-tune them to be utilized for multiple use-cases without having to build models from the ground up repeatedly. The most popularly used foundational models today utilize transformers (text generation)/diffusers (i.e., image generation) to achieve this adaptability. These models have potential applicability across a wide range of use-cases and industry verticals ranging from chatbots and virtual assistants to generating videos completely via text prompts for marketing.
